American Recovery and Reinvestment Act Training: Construction Project Compliance 
 
The Alliance for Construction Excellence (ACE) proudly offers training on the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), which provides Federal funding for public entity construction projects. Learn about compliance issues and examine the required action items including:
 
* Contractor and subcontractor compliance with Federally-assisted construction requirements, such as Buy American, Davis Bacon and related Acts for worker protections and Civil Rights compliance
 
* Public entity application of Federal contractor and subcontractor requirements
 
Accurate and timely action by contractors, subcontractors and public entities is critical.  The Federal government expects full compliance and is taking significant monitoring steps. Gain insight into these Federally mandated requirements and ensure your organization is positioned to implement the ARRA funding by attending ACE’s online ARRA training and review program. In cooperation with iLinc Communications, an Arizona web-based training-solutions provider, the training is available online and is segmented into one hour pre-recorded modules and is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week so you can review the training whenever you want!
